Hey, the UI looks really good overall 👍
I just have a few small tweaks:

Please reduce the neon/glow effect a bit, it’s slightly too strong.

Some text is black where it should be gray or lighter for better readability.

The Stocks and Crypto buttons can be styled a bit cleaner and more polished.

Please remove the empty bubble-style button at the top.

Change the Try Finmate button to a red, white, and gray theme to better match the website.

Other than these points, please don’t change anything else. Thanks!
